 You will never believe what happened
to me today. I still can't get over it. I
went to the supermarket by d road side to
pick
something to eat pending d time I get home.
As I was
walking to d counter, I
noticed this woman starring at me. I
looked at her and kept walking to the
front
to pick bottled water and gala. As I picked them and turned, I found the same
woman right behind me! I tried to
show her some
love, so I smiled & said "Gudday maa". Then I
went on to get a teen bita lemon. Can u
believe the same woman followed me? I was getting a
little bit
nervous and mad because she was
following me without saying a thing.
But I tried to stay friendly, I just said
"Gudday maa" again. She finally responded and
said, "I am sorry for starring, but you look
just
like
my youngest son
We just buried him two weeks ago" I felt silly for getting
mad as I expressed my sympathy to
her. She said she was fine as she
knows that his Child is with the Lord. She
then
asked me to do her a favour
which I obliged. She said "I'm a bit sad
that my child never said goodbye to
me before
passing on". She said i wil sumtin 4 her, she
asked me to get in
line behind her so when she's leaving the
store, I
should say "goodbye
mum" so she could have some sense
of closure. Though her request was weird, I however
agreed to grant it. So as she collected
her bags from the cashier and walked away,
I
said
"bye mum". She turned and said "bye my son". When d cashier
calculated my stuff, she said d total
was N18,750. I said what!!!
Can u tell me how a N70 bottled water,
N50 gala and N100 teen bitter lemon equals
N18,750? She said "your mum
said you are paying for hers too". My
mum? I shouted. That woman is not
my mother ooo!!!. I quickly rushed out
just in time to see the woman
approaching the parking lot. I ran after her and
was
screaming..excuse
me, excuse me!!!". She started
running. I caught
up with her just before she was able to close the door of her
 cab. I kept on
pulling and pulling her leg, just like I am
pulling
yours now! You too like
